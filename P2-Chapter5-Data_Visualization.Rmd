This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
chart_data <- round(runif(10,100,1000))
names(chart_data) <- c("2014-1","2015-1","2014-2", "2015-2","2014-3","2015-3","2014-4","2015-4","2017-3","2017-2")
pie(chart_data)
barplot(chart_data)
#help(barplot)
barplot(chart_data, ylim=c(0,600), ylab = "Sales(won)", xlab = "Quarterly",col = rainbow(8), main= "Quarterly Sales Comp")
barplot(chart_data, ylim = c(0, )

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
